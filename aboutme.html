      <p>Hello! My name is Francisco Hernandez, a passionate 23-year-old tech enthusiast from the dazzling city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Since childhood, technology has played a vital role in my life, especially in the realms of video games and theater. The captivating fantasy and sci-fi worlds in both interactive and cinematic experiences have consistently inspired me, motivating me to explore this fascinating field. I am drawn to the art of crafting immersive narratives, designing intricate world-building, and discovering the limitless potential these genres offer. One of my most ambitious dreams is to own DC Comics someday, revolutionizing the way iconic superheroes and their stories are brought to life across various platforms. My enthusiasm for contributing to the creation of awe-inspiring, unforgettable experiences, and sharing them with others, fuels my passion for technology.</p>

      <h2>Career Goals</h2>
      <p>I aim to secure an entry-level software development position before the year concludes. My ideal career path would be within a company that produces my favorite movies or games, such as Warner Bros. or Bungie. I have a particular interest in game development, as I believe games possess the power to entertain, educate, and inspire people of all ages and backgrounds. As a lifelong gamer myself, I understand the importance of crafting immersive and engaging experiences that captivate players and leave them wanting more.</p>
      <p>My ultimate aspiration is to lead DC Comics, creating movies, games, and comics that I've always wanted to see come to life and which I believe audiences deserve. To achieve this, I plan to refine my skills in programming, storytelling, and project management. I'm constantly seeking opportunities for growth, whether through online courses, attending industry events, or collaborating with fellow creators.</p>
      <p>One challenge I face in realizing my career goals is the competitive nature of the tech industry. There are numerous talented and skilled developers out there, making it difficult to stand out. However, I believe my passion, creativity, and perseverance distinguish me and provide an advantage in this field. I am dedicated to working diligently, embracing risks, and learning from my mistakes to achieve my dreams.</p>
